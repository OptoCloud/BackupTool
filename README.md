# Backup Tool

Efficiently back up files while respecting project-specific exclusions such as those defined in .gitignore files, and automatically detected project folders like Unity to prevent backup bloat. The tool hashes all fetched files, organizes them in a database, and creates compressed tar archives, integrating with 7zip for compression.
